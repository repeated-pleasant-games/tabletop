# Tabletop

Tabletop is a feature-light virtual tabletop (VTT) that provides the bare
essentials for playing tabletop roleplaying games online.

> _Why a new repository, Joe?_ Well, after thinking about the design of the
> app I was building and the problems I wanted to solve, I realized that [the
> old repo](https://github.com/repeated-pleasant-games/tabletop-old) had grown
> into a mess - even after a major refactor. Features were unscoped, there was
> no solid foundation, and there was no end goal, only a lot of creep. This
> repository isn't > going to fix those problems, but it gives me a chance to
> start over and build > from hard requirements instead of loose desires.
